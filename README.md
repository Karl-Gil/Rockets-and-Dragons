# Rockets-and-Dragons
Hi, The code above is for a Java based app called "Rockets and Dragons" which was devloped on Google's Android Studio.
To view the main java code please follow https://github.com/Karl-Gil/Rockets-and-Dragons/blob/2a6628ad9a5fe6b5a98d78df0ae58bc048a43692/app/src/main/java/com/example/app14/MainActivity.java 


# What is Rockets and Dragons
Rockets and Dragons is an app which is designed to promote safer internet usage within children. Version 1.0 is designed for an android tablet which can be used with children in the class room. Rockets and Dragons is similiar to a board game but it is hosted as an app. I wanted to create Rockets and Dragons to be a fun and interactive method of learning which will in turn increase the learning aspect of the app.


# How does the app work?
Each Rocket and Dragon has a key word. These key words correspond to the various key cards which I have created. I have designed the app in a way that the key words can be related to the lives of our younger socity. An example of a key card is " Cookies", which explains what are cookies and how they can effect our online presence. Each card consists of a few bullet points which have been audio described by me and which is buit directly into the app.

# Demo
I have produced a demo video which shows how the app functions, this demo can be viewed here https://rocketsanddragons.ie/app-demonstration
